I write clear, impactful sentences. 
### I like working with... 
Kind, collaborative, high-performing people who are smarter than I am and enjoy laughing.

Website setup with Jekyll, and help from Anthropic-Claude Opus 4.5 and
Pat Dryburgh's [Hitchens theme:](https://www.github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens) and converting content to Markdown with pandoc via zshell.
