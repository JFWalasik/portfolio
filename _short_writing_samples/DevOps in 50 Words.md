DevOps is a system and practice where software development and ongoing operations (including
software infrastructure, monitoring, security, and maintenance) are combined into one team,
empowering developers to more quickly deliver and deploy stable and robust applications and
code. It requires engineers to develop and use skills from the entire software development
lifecycle, and not simply a single functional area.
