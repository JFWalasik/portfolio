**Optics** is the *theoretical* field of light, i.e. the behavior of light. Think: Einstein imagining what it was like to ride on a beam of light, or what would happen to light around a black hole.
<br>
<br>
**Photonics** is the *applied* field of light (photons) and includes lasers, fiber optics, diagnostic imaging, and light sensors (barcode scanners, LiDAR).
<br>
<br>
**Free Space Optical Communications** is using light beams for wireless communications. I.e., Wi-Fi with light instead of radio frequencies/waves. (1G-5G Wi-Fi are radio waves. 6G will be too. 7G or 8G might be with light waves). Here, "free space" means wireless, to distinguish it from fiber optics or transmission through a solid medium. Space X Starlink is a well-known example of free space optical communications.
<br>
<br>
**Adaptive Optics** is using sensors and mirrors to improve *free space optical communications*.
