Immigration practitioners have become aware of substantive changes to U.S. immigration which can restrict benefits and movement. While not attributable to any single regulation or mandate, we have observed a shift in how USCIS, DOS, and CBP conduct business in a more restrictive manner. 

This has included: 
-	Increased vetting or administrative processing of visas at U.S. consulates; 
-	Enhanced scrutiny of social media;
-	New fees (advanced parole and H-1B) that make entry to the U.S. impractical for some; 
-	New requirements (e.g., electronic payments) that can limit access; 
-	Additional scrutiny (e.g., rescinding automatic EAD extensions for more vetting); and
-	Other unexpected delays and requirements, often for obscure and unlikely reasons.

While many are unaffected by these incremental changes and experience little or no problems, others can find themselves delayed for reasons that couldn’t have been anticipated. Diverse and rapidly implemented changes can now cause issues that were unheard of just a year ago. We therefore encourage immigrants, businesses, and families to be aware of this changing environment, plan ahead and consult with immigration counsel, and have a backup plan when petitioning or applying for immigration benefits.
