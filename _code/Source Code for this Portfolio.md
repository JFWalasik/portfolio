[Portfolio Source Code](https://github.com/JFWalasik/portfolio)
<br>
<br>
Forked from [Pat Dryburgh's](https://patdryburgh.com/) [Hitchens theme](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/)
<br>
<br>
I liked the look of the theme, but wanted a portfolio site with the ability to add images of clickable "featured items," and folders with collections of writing and other samples. After about 400 [commits](https://github.com/JFWalasik/portfolio/commits/master/) and several "you've hit your session limit" messages from Claude, it's starting to look okay.
