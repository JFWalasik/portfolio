[Portfolio Source Code](https://github.com/JFWalasik/portfolio)
<br>
<br>
Forked from [Pat Dryburgh's](https://patdryburgh.com/) [Hitchens theme](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/)
<br>
<br>
I looked the look of the theme, but wanted a portfolio site with the ability to add images of clickable "featured items," and folders with collections of writing and other samples. About 400 commits later, it's starting to look okay.
